<p><center>Attributes are the characteristics or properties of an element, object,</center></br>or entity that provide additional information about it. </br>In various contexts, such as computer programming, data analysis, or web development, attributes play a crucial role in defining the behavior, appearance, or functionality of an element. </br>For instance, in HTML, attributes are used to specify the properties of an HTML element, </br>  such as its width, height, color, or font size. </br> Similarly, in a database, attributes refer to the columns or fields that define the characteristics of a table or entity. </br> By assigning attributes to an element or object, we can provide more context, meaning, and functionality to it.</p>.
