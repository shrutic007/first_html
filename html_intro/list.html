     <ol>
         <li><b>Preparation:</b></li>
            <p><blockquote>Rinse, peel and cube 3 medium or 2 larger potatoes (about 300 grams). Mine were about 1½ to 2 cups when measured. Clean 1 cup cauliflower florets (optional). Rinse 1½ to ³¼ cups green peas. If you want you can also use 1 medium carrot (Half cup chopped).</br>

For making masala, chop 1 medium onion (3½ to 1 cup chopped), 2 medium tomatoes (3¼ to 1 cup chopped), half bell pepper (1½ cup chopped) and 1 green chilli. Also make 1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste. Keep all of these aside.</blockquote></p>
          <ol type="i">
            <li>Add potatoes, cauliflower, peas & carrots (optional) to a pressure cooker or a pot. Pour 1½ cups water, it should be just enough to cover them partially.</li>
            <li>Pressure cook for 1 to 2 whistles on a medium flame. I pressure cook for only 1 whistle.</li>
            <li>When the pressure releases open the lid. Veggies should be soft cooked. Mash them well.</li>
         </ol>
         <li><b>Prepare Onion Tomato masala:</b></li>
         <ol type="i"> 
              <li>Heat 1 tablespoon butter & 1 tablespoon oil in a pan.</li>
              <li>Add 3/4 to 1 cup chopped onions. Saute till they turn translucent.</li>
              <li>Add 1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste and 1 green chilli. Fry until it smells good. Take care not to burn.</li>
              <li>Add half cup chopped bell pepper. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
              <li>Add 3 to 1 cup chopped tomatoes and 1 teaspoon salt. Fry till tomatoes turn mushy, soft and pulpy.</li>
              <li>Add 1 teaspoon chilli powder and 1 to 12 tablespoon paav bhaji masala powder. If making for kids, skip the chilli powder but it will affect the color.</li>
              <li>Mix well and fry for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
         </ol>
         <li><b>Make Bhaji:</b></li>
         <ol type="i">
             <li>Add the boiled & mashed veggies. Add ½ to ³¼ cups more water to bring it to a consistency.</li>
             <li>Mix well and simmer for a while to bring out the flavor of masala.</br>Taste test and add more salt if you want. You can also add more chili powder at this stage for brighter color. Also for more flavor you may add more pav bhaji masala if you want.</li>
             <li>Add ³¼ tablespoon kasuri methi.</br>When it reaches the desired consistency, add chopped coriander leaves. switch off. Slightly cool down and add some lemon juice before serving.</li>
         </ol>
         <li><b>Toast Pav:</b></li>
         <ol type='i'>
            <li>Slit the pav horizontally leaving one edge intact. On a low flame, heat 1 teaspoon butter on a tawa. Add little masala powder over it.</li>
            <li>Place the pav on the butter and toast for 1 to 2 mins until slightly crisp. Do not over do it as the spice powder will burn. You can do the same on the other side as well by adding more butter on the pan.</li>
         </ol>
     </ol>
     <p><blockquote>Garnish with coriander leaves, lemon wedges and chopped onions. Top with more butter on hot bhaji. Serve pav bhaji with some butter topped and onion.</blockqupte></p>
